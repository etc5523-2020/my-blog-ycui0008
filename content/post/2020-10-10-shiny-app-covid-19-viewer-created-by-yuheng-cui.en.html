<h2>Introduce <code>Covid-19 view</code></h2>
<p>This App is used to monitor global covid-19 cases and deaths, and it can compare the covid-19 cases in different countries.</p>
<p>There are four tabs: <code>Map</code>, <code>Table</code>, <code>Graphs</code>, and `About.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Map</code>: This tab has two leaflet maps. The first one shows the global <code>cumulative_cases</code>. The second one shows the global <code>cumulative_deaths</code>. Because the dataset contains huge amount of values, the leaflet maps take much time to run. So, please be patient.</li>
<li><code>Table</code>: This tab shows the latest covid-19 <code>new_cases</code>, <code>cumulative_cases</code>, <code>new_deaths</code>, and <code>cumulative_deaths</code> of selected countries. User can select multiple countries to compare them.</li>
<li><code>Graphs</code>: There are one column plot and one line plot in this tab. The column plot help user compare the latest <code>cumulative_cases</code> and <code>cumulative_deaths</code> of selected countries. The line plot tells user the <code>new_cases</code> and <code>new_deaths</code> of selected countries. With these two plots, user can understand how successful selected countries control the coronavirus pandemic.</li>
<li><code>About</code>: This tab has short introduction about <code>Covid-19 viewer</code> and its creator. It also contains the <code>Acknowledgments</code> and <code>References</code> sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download this App from <a href="https://github.com/etc5523-2020/shiny-assessment-ycui0008">Github</a>.</p>

<h2>Self Review</h2>
<div id="what-did-i-do-well" class="section level3">
<h3>What did I do well</h3>
<p>First, this is my first time to do shiny, I did a lot of self study and complete it without any bugs.</p>
<p>Second, it spends me 3 nights to deal with leaflet output for shiny app. During the process, I have trouble to create circle markers within leaflet maps. Thanks Stuart for helping me solve this problem!</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-the-points-i-can-improve-on" class="section level3">
<h3>What are the points I can improve on?</h3>
<p>Loading my leaflet map in the first tab is time-consuming. Every time a user change the slide bar, it would take at least 10 seconds to show the results.</p>
<p>After completion of my About tab, I know a better way to write texts/paragraphs in shiny.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-are-some-things-that-id-like-to-add-thats-plausible" class="section level3">
<h3>What are some things that I’d like to add that’s plausible?</h3>
<p>First, I want to make the line plot in Graph tab animated. The animated plot would look more entertaining.</p>
<p>Second, I want to make users be able to upload csv file in a tab called “Upload file”; after uploading the csv file, the App will draw maps and plots based on the latest dataset. This function can release the app maintainer from updating the covid-19 dataset every day.</p>

<h3>What are some things that I’d like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology?</h3>
<p>In my plan, the leaflet map will look like the plot below, this plot is from <a href="https://covid19.who.int/">WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard</a>. But after several-days tries, I still could not figure it out.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/who-dashboard.png" alt ="" /></p>
<p>I also plan to make it available for users to upload csv files by themselves. But after two days, I still cannot solve it.</p>
