<p>The first post is about COVID19 in RUssia. The dataset is from <a href="https://covid19.who.int/table">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>.</p>
<p>WHO classifies COVID-19 transmission in Russia as <em>clusters of cases</em>. WHO defines clusters of cases as “cases that are clustered in time, geographic location and or by common exposures”.</p>
<p>Russia has 146,748,590 people. It has large country area but only a small proportion of the areas in which people are willing to live. This could be one of reasons of <em>clusters of cases</em> in Russia.</p>
