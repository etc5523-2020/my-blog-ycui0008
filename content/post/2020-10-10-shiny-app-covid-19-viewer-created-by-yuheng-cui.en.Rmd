## Introduce `Covid-19 view`

This App is used to monitor global covid-19 cases and deaths, and it can compare the covid-19 cases in different countries.

There are four tabs: `Map`, `Table`, `Graphs`, and `About.

* `Map`: This tab has two leaflet maps. The first one shows the global `cumulative_cases`. The second one shows the global `cumulative_deaths`. Because the dataset contains huge amount of values, the leaflet maps take much time to run. So, please be patient.
* `Table`: This tab shows the latest covid-19 `new_cases`, `cumulative_cases`, `new_deaths`, and `cumulative_deaths` of selected countries. User can select multiple countries to compare them.
* `Graphs`: There are one column plot and one line plot in this tab. The column plot help user compare the latest `cumulative_cases` and `cumulative_deaths` of selected countries. The line plot tells user the `new_cases` and `new_deaths` of selected countries. With these two plots, user can understand how successful selected countries control the coronavirus pandemic.
* `About`: This tab has short introduction about `Covid-19 viewer` and its creator. It also contains the `Acknowledgments` and `References` sections.

## Self Review

### What did I do well

First, this is my first time to do shiny, I did a lot of self study and complete it without any bugs. 

Second, it spends me 3 nights to deal with leaflet output for shiny app. During the process, I have trouble to create circle markers within leaflet maps. Thanks Stuart for helping me solve this problem!

### What are the points you can improve on?

Loading my leaflet map in the first tab is time-consuming. Every time a user change the slide bar, it would take at least 10 seconds to show the results. 

After completion of my About tab, I know a better way to write texts in shiny. 

### What are some things that I'd like to add that's plausible?

First, I want to make the line plot in Graph tab animated. But I'm not sure whether the 
Second, ecause it is annoying for App maintainer to update the dataset daily. I want to make users be able to upload csv file in a tab called "Upload file", and the csv file will be processed by the App.
Third, if I have more time, I would like to create a covid-19 viewer for America. It will show the cases, deaths, new cases and new deaths for each state.

### What are some things that I'd like to add that cannot be done yet due to limitation in data or technology?

In my plan, the leaflet map will look like the image below, this plot is from [WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard](https://covid19.who.int/). But after several-days tries, I still could not figure it out.

I also plan to make it available for users to upload csv files by themselves. But after two days, I still cannot solve it.
